## /Sum/:
**Difference Engine** is a minimalistic diff data analyzer, specifically designed for generation of lightweight patching utils. It's rather simple to put in use without any prior knowledge of binary alteration mechanics.
Was never flagged by AVs so far.

##/Featurae/:
-	Fully native implementation with no external dependencies. Proven to work on XP and beyond.
-	Extensive commandline automation support. Could be used as classical shell utility.
-	Rather minimalistic Win98-inspired GUI.
-	XCopy-based installation.

## /Reassembling/:
**Difference Engine** is written completely in *PureBasic v4.40*, though compatible with *5.2x (LTS)*.  
To rebuild project use 'Main.pb' as root sourcefile for main .exe and 'Template.pb' to compile 'Template.App.'
